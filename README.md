# Solana and SLP tokens Transfer Script

This script automates the process of transferring SOL and SPL tokens using the Solana blockchain. It is designed for efficient transactions and includes adjustable compute unit fees and limits.

## Why I Created This Script

I had four Solana wallets that were compromised due to a scam, resulting in the loss of all my funds. These wallets were my main wallets for trading, and I was eligible to claim JUP and Pengu tokens. When I tried to claim normally from Jupiter, I was not fast enough to transfer my 1000 JUP to another safe walletâ€”the scammer was faster. 

To prevent this from happening again, I created this script to make transactions faster and more efficient, ensuring that I could securely transfer funds before any unauthorized access could take place.

## Features

- Transfers SOL with configurable compute unit fees and limits.
- Automatically transfers all SPL tokens held in the sender's wallet.
- Uses environment variables for security.
- Provides real-time feedback on wallet balances and transactions.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure that you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository from GitHub. Download it from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **Python**: Install Python (version 3 or higher) as some dependencies may require Python during installation. Download it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).
4. **Solana RPC Provider**: It is recommended to use a private free RPC like [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) for better performance and faster transactions.
5. **Minimum SOL Balance**: Ensure that your wallet has at least **0.005 SOL** to cover transaction fees.
6. **Dependencies**: The following npm packages are required:
   - `@solana/web3.js`
   - `bs58`
   - `dotenv`
   - `@solana/spl-token`

To install these dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install @solana/web3.js bs58 dotenv @solana/spl-token
```

## Installation

Follow these detailed steps to install and run the script:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ben5652/Solana-and-SLP-tokens-Transfer-Script.git
cd Solana-and-SLP-tokens-Transfer-Script
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Python (if not already installed)

To check if Python is installed, run:
```bash
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, download and install it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 4: Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=recipient-public-key
RPC_URL=https://YOUR_api-key
```
Replace `your-private-key` with your wallet's private key in Base58 format, `recipient-public-key` with the public key of the recipient wallet, and `https://YOUR_api-key` with the actual RPC URL from your provider.

### Step 5: Set Up an RPC Provider

To improve speed and reliability, use a private RPC endpoint:
1. Sign up for a free RPC provider like [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/).
2. Get your RPC endpoint URL.
3. Open `script.js` and ensure it reads from the `.env` file:
   ```js
   dotenv.config();
   const connection = new web3.Connection(process.env.RPC_URL, 'processed');
   ```

### Step 6: Fund Your Wallet

Ensure your wallet has at least **0.005 SOL** for transaction fees. You can check your balance using:
```bash
solana balance
```
If needed, deposit SOL from an exchange or another wallet.

### Step 7: Run the Script

Execute the script using Node.js:
```bash
node auto-Transfer.js
```

### What Happens?

1. The script fetches the SOL and SPL token balances from your wallet.
2. It transfers all SOL (leaving a buffer for transaction fees) to the recipient address.
3. It transfers all SPL tokens to the recipient address.
4. It repeats the process in a loop until terminated.

## Notes

- Ensure that your private key is stored securely and not shared publicly.
- Adjust compute unit fees and limits in the script to suit your transaction needs.
- Monitor your wallet balance to avoid transaction failures due to insufficient funds.
- **IMPORTANT:** If you want to transfer SOL, there is no problem, but if you want to auto-transfer SPL tokens like JUP or other tokens, it is recommended to first transfer or buy a small amount of the token to the recipient wallet. This will open a slot in advance for a faster transaction.
